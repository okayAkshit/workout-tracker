User Accounts: Add authentication so multiple users can track their workouts separately.

Analytics Dashboard: Visualize progress with charts for weights, reps, and sets over time.

REST API Integration: Expose workout data via APIs to connect with other fitness apps.

AI & Recommendations: Use machine learning to suggest workouts based on past performance.

Notifications & Reminders: Send daily or weekly workout reminders via email or push notifications.

Gamification: Add achievements, badges, or streak tracking to motivate users.

Export & Reports: Allow exporting workout history to CSV or PDF for personal records or sharing with trainers.
